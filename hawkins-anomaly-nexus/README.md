# Hawkins Anomaly Nexus (HANex) 🕵️‍♂️🧊

> *A gamified, state-of-the-art 3D Virtualization platform for detecting, reporting, and resolving mysterious anomalies in Hawkins.*

## 📖 Overview
HANex is a community-driven Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to mobilize citizens in the event of supernatural or systemic anomalies. Re-imagined for Phase 2, the interface has transitioned from a retro terminal to a **modern 3D virtualization environment** featuring glassmorphism, dynamic scenes, and real-time intelligence telemetry.

The system uses **AI-driven categorization** to route anomaly reports to three specialized sectors:
1.  **🔵 Government (Blue Theme):** Security breaches, physical anomalies, and tactical containment.
2.  **🟣 Job/Skill (Purple Theme):** Tech glitches requiring specialized skills (coding, engineering).
3.  **🟢 Health (Green Theme):** Biological hazards, symptoms, and medical guidance.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📡 Anomaly Reporting & Neural Routing
- Users submit text descriptions of strange events.
- **GAIA AI** automatically classifies reports and routes users to the appropriate response protocol.
- *Examples:* "Dimensional tear" -> **Government** | "Terminal corruption" -> **Job/Skill** | "Alien spores" -> **Health**.

### 2. 🏛️ Government Sector (Tactical Hub)
- **3D Tactical Map:** Visualizes anomalies on an interactive coordinate grid with real-time signatures.
- **Secure Virtual Rooms:** Translucent, glassmorphism-based chat channels for field operatives.
- **Resolve Protocol:** Authorization to "close" anomalies, restoring dimensional stability and earning XP.

### 3. 💼 Job & Skill Module (Virtual Ops)
- **Skill Development Protocol:** Guided 3D learning tracks for React, Node.js, and more.
- **Code Challenges:** Timed, high-stakes coding environments **Powered by CodeCrafters**.
- **Neural-Link Evaluation:** Context-aware mock interviews generated from active anomaly reports.
- **Geek Room:** Exclusive collaborative channels for verified operatives.

### 4. 🏥 Health Module (Bio-Scanner)
- **3D Bio-Scanner:** Futuristic interactive checklist for biological threat assessment.
- **Neural Guidance:** Rule-based triage advice (Low/Medium/High urgency).
- **Bio-Log:** Secure history of reported symptoms and medical virtualization telemetry.

### 5. 🎮 Virtual progression
- **XP System:** Earn points for transmissions, solved challenges, and field resolutions.
- **Accreditations:** Unlock badges like "Gate Hunter" or "Bio-Veteran".
- **Agent Profile:** Digital ID card displaying clearance levels and neural stats.

## 🎨 Virtualization Design System

The V04 interface is built on a **3D Glassmorphism** design system:
- **Scenes:** Backgrounds evolve based on the active sector (Blue Geometric / Purple Network / Green Bio-Spheres).
- **Glass-Panels:** Translucent UI elements with 12px blur and vibrant borders.
- **Typography:** Inter for readability; Roboto for tactical headers.
- **Colors:** 
  - `GOV_BLUE`: #3b82f6 (Tactical)
  - `TECH_PURPLE`: #8b5cf6 (Skill)
  - `BIO_GREEN`: #10b981 (Health)
