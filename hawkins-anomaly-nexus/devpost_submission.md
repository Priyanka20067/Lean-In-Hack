# Devpost / Hackathon Submission Details

## 🏆 Primary Track: Open Innovation

**How our project fits:**
HANex is an open-ended problem-solving platform designed to handle multiple real-world challenges—government issues, healthcare guidance, and job/skill development—through a single unified system.

Instead of focusing on one fixed problem, HANex adapts dynamically based on what users report. This flexibility and cross-domain approach make it a strong example of open innovation, where one solution evolves to solve many societal problems.

## 🏛️ Secondary Track: Civic / GovTech

**How our project fits:**
HANex enables citizens to report civic issues such as infrastructure damage, streetlight failures, and public service problems. These reports are:
- **Automatically categorized** by AI.
- **Visualized on a tactical map.**
- **Tracked through status updates** (Open -> Resolved).

An authority/admin dashboard (The "Secure Room") simulates real government workflows, improving transparency, accountability, and response tracking. This aligns directly with GovTech goals of improving citizen-government interaction.

## 🏥 Secondary Track: Healthcare

**How our project fits:**
The healthcare module in HANex provides:
- **Symptom-based guidance**
- **Safety-first rule-based analysis** (Triage)
- **Health reminders and medical logs**

The system does not provide diagnosis and avoids risky AI claims. Instead, it helps users take early action and track health history responsibly, making it suitable for digital health and preventive care use cases.

## 🎓 Secondary Track: Education & Skill Development

**How our project fits:**
HANex addresses job and skill challenges by:
- **Identifying skill gaps** from user reports (e.g., reporting a "glitch" suggests IT skills).
- **Suggesting structured learning paths** (React, Node.js).
- **Providing coding challenges** with real-time validation.
- **Conducting dynamic mock interviews** based on context.
- **Building a skill-based profile** with XP and badges.

This shifts focus from resumes to demonstrated skills, aligning with modern education and workforce development needs.

## 🤝 Secondary Track: Social Impact / Community Empowerment

**How our project fits:**
HANex is designed with a community-first approach, encouraging people to:
- **Collaborate** on solving issues.
- **Support learning and mentoring** via Geek Rooms.
- **Build trust through transparency.**

By empowering communities instead of relying only on authorities, HANex creates measurable social impact.

## 🏆 Sponsor Tracks

### 🚀 Sponsor Track: CodeCrafters

**How HANex aligns with CodeCrafters:**
HANex adopts a CodeCrafters-style learning philosophy:
- **Learn by doing**
- **Solve real problems**
- **Prove skills through tasks**

In the Job/Skill module:
- Users follow **structured learning paths**.
- Complete **coding challenges**.
- Earn **XP and skill scores** based on performance.

This mirrors the hands-on, project-based learning approach promoted by CodeCrafters, making HANex a strong conceptual fit for this sponsor track.

### 🤓 Sponsor Track: Geek Room

**How HANex aligns with Geek Room:**
HANex integrates community collaboration through **Geek Rooms** where users:
- **Discuss problems** in skill-specific channels.
- **Help peers with coding challenges.**
- **Mentor beginners.**
- **Coordinate investigations** for reported issues.

This aligns with Geek Room’s vision of building collaborative, knowledge-sharing communities rather than isolated problem solving.
